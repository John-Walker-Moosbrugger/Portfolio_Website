            John Walker is actually my first name, that’s usually pretty confusing.

                I have been working with astrobotic as a concept designer since July 2017. This work has included designing landers, rovers and other spacecraft to illustrate projects they are currently implementing.

                From models to architecture, photorealistic renderings can be key to selling an idea or a product. I can work from scratch, from a CAD model, or from a photo.

                I’ve been designing, building and breaking things for as long as I can remember; but my first real exposure to design as a skill was freshman year of college. I dove straight in. First with theatre, designing scenery and then branching out until I found myself working on everything from lunar robots and hyperloop systems, to augmented reality CAD programs and websites. <br>
                <br>

                I have a particular passion for design in service of a story. Whether it’s the story of a startup or a vision for the future of transportation, finding the core of an idea and telling that story. 
                <br>
                <br>
                
                In service of that goal I have found myself becoming a web-developer, animator, video editor, VR artist graphic designer and much more. The more work I do the more the medium becomes just another tool and I have put my whole focus into the design.
